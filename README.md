## A Script to Look for Trends in the Market

### THIS IS NOT FINIACIAL ADVICE
This is provided for informational purposes only and should not be used as financial advice. I am not a financial advisor, this tool is not a substitute for research and a consultation with a financial advisor. 

### Running the Script
1. You will need to get a valid API key for all data sources (currently just one), see the sample secret configuration file for an example of the expected configuration.
2. You can adjust the data sources and depth of the search using the public configuration file.
3. You may need to install any missing packages.
4. Run the main.py file, it will print out the results to the console. Note that due to rate limiting the initial data collection can take a long time.
